### Introduction
In this section, you will learn how to create file in C programming language .
### Points To Remember While Creating File
- **Open Mode (fopen())**:fopen function is used to open files in C, and it takes two main arguments: the file path and the mode.
- **Close Files(fclose())**: Always close files using fclose after operations.
- **Choose the Right Mode**: Select the appropriate file opening mode based on the intended operations ("r", "w", "a", "r+", etc.).
- **Path Awareness**: Be mindful of file paths.

### Example
Here is a simple C program that creates a file named "test.txt" and writes some content into it.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // File pointer
    FILE *file;

    // Open file in write mode ("w")
    file = fopen("test.txt", "w");

    // Check if the file is opened successfully
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Error creating file!\n");
        return 1; // Return an error code
    }

    // Write content to the file
    fprintf(file, "This is a different file created in C.\n");
    fprintf(file, "You can use any file name you prefer!\n");

    // Close the file
    fclose(file);

    printf("File created successfully: output.txt\n");

    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```
