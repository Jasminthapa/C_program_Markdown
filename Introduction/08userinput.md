### User Input In C
Instead of writing hard-coded values, you can give input to the computer.It allows for  enabling customization, flexibility, and dynamic behavior. Programming language provide many built-in functions present in C header files.
Thr I/O functions that are used in C are:
1) scanf() and printf() functions
2) getschar() and putchar() functions
3) gets and puts

1) **scanf() and printf() functions**
- In C programming,scanf() and printf() functions are basic function .We can use them by using #include<stdio.h> directive.
**scanf()**  is used to get input from the user.Generally ,it is written as:
```c
scanf("%d",a);
```
**printf()** is used  to display message to user.Generally ,it is written as:
```c
printf("messaged to be display",variable1,variable2,...);
 Example :
 ```c
 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare variables to store user input
    int num;
    float floatingNumber;
    char character;
    //asked user enter an integer
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    
    // Read integer input from the user and store it in the 'number' variable
    scanf("%d", &num);
    
    // ask user to enter a floating-point number
    printf("Enter a floating-point number: ");
    
    // Read floating-point input from the user and store it in the 'floatingNumber' variable
    scanf("%f", &floatingNumber);
    printf("You entered: \n");// to display it in proper way .
    printf("Integer: %d\n", num);
    printf("Floating-point number: %f\n", floatingNumber);
    return 0;
}
```
2) **getschar() and putchar() functions**

In C, getchar() and putchar() are functions used for character input and output, respectively.
- **getchar()** is a function in C that reads a single character and returns it as an integer representing the character's ASCII value.Syntax is given by:
```c 
int getchar(void);
```
example:
```c 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char c;
    
    printf("Enter a character: ");
    ch = getchar(); // Read a character from input
    
    printf("You entered: %c\n", ch);
    return 0;
}
```
**putchar()** is a function in C used to write a single character to the standard output.putchar() takes a single argument, character, which is an integer representing the character to be written.
Syntax is given as:
```c 
int putchar(int character);
```
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char c = 'D';

    printf("Using putchar(): ");
    putchar(c); 
    return 0;
}
```
{{% notice info %}} Note:It takes a single character as an argument and prints it to the console.{{% notice info %}}

3) **gets and puts**
In C programming,**gets()** and **puts()** are functions used for reading and writing strings to and from the standard input and output respectively.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_LENGTH 100 // Maximum length of the input string

int main() {
    char inputString[MAX_LENGTH];

    // Using gets() to read a string from the user
    printf("Enter a string: ");
    gets(inputString);

    // Using puts() to display the entered string
    printf("Entered string: ");
    puts(inputString);

    return 0;
}
```
Here,gets() reads a line of text.
- puts() prints a string .
### String User Input
They are used for storing textual user input. If you want to keep values like somebodyâ€™s name, address, description, etc., you can take string input from the user. One common method is using fgets() to read a line of text and store it into a character array.
Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_LENGTH 100 // Maximum length of the input string

int main() {
    char inputString[MAX_LENGTH];

    printf("Enter a string: ");
    fgets(inputString, sizeof(inputString), stdin);

    printf("Entered string: %s", inputString);

    return 0;
}
```
Here, 
- fgets() reads a line of text from the standard input and stores it in the inputString character array.
- sizeof(inputString) specifies the maximum number of characters that fgets() can read (to prevent buffer overflow).
- stdin is the standard input stream (the keyboard).
### Integer User Input

In C programming, you can take integer input from the user using the scanf() function.
```c 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    printf("Entered integer is : %d", number);

    return 0;
}
``` 
### Floating Point User Input
You can use float input if you want to get a numeric value from the user with the decimal point.E.g. 10.00, 10.5, -8.9 etc.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double number;

    printf("Enter a floating number: ");
    scanf("%f", &number);

    printf("The entered number is %f\n", number);

    return 0;
}
```

{{% notice info %}}**Note**:&number is used to pass the address of the number variable to scanf() so that it can store the entered floating-point value in that memory location.
{{% /notice %}}
