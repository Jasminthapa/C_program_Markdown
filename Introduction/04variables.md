### Variables 
- A variable in a program is a name given to memory loctaion that stores the value which can change throughout the program.
- Simply, a variable is just a container which stores value.For eg:

```c
int num = 10;
```
Here num is a variable of integer type with integer value 10
Simply,syntax of variables can be declared as
Datatype variablename1,variablename2,.....;
For eg: 
- Variable can be String or numeric.

### Variable Types
- int:Used for storing whole numbers.e.g:10, -10, 996
- float:Used for storing decimal numbers with single precision.E.g.10.0, -10.2, 85.698 etc.
- double:Used for storing decimal numbers with double precision.E.g.3.14159, 4.3335 etc.
char:Used for storing individual characters.E.g.'A','B'etc.
- Bool:Used for storing true or false values.E.g. true, false [Only stores true or false values]


### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declaring Variables
    char name[] = "John";
    char address[] = "USA";
    int age = 20;
    float height = 5.9;
    _Bool isMarried = 0; // 0 represents false in C

    // Printing variables value
    printf("Name is %s\n", name);
    printf("Address is %s\n", address);
    printf("Age is %d\n", age);
    printf("Height is %.2f\n", height); // %.2f for two decimal places
    printf("Married Status is %s\n", isMarried ? "true" : "false");

    return 0;
}
```
{{% notice info %}}**Note**:Here \n is used for next line.
{{% /notice %}}

### Rules for writting variables In C**
- Must begin with alphabets or an underscore.
- The lowercase and uppercase are different.For eg:name and Name is different.
- Keywords can't be as variable name.
- White space should be avoided between variables names.But we can use underscore to join.
- Only 31 characters are significant.

### C Constant
Constant is the type of variable whose value never changes. In programming, changeable values are mutable and unchangeable values are immutable. Sometimes, you donâ€™t need to change the value once declared. Like the value of PI=3.14, it never changes. To create a constant in C, you can use the #define keyword.
```c 
#include <stdio.h>

#define PI 3.1
int main() {
    printf("Value of PI: %f\n", PI);
 return 0;
}
```
## Naming Convention For Variables In C
It is a good habit to follow the naming convention.  Variables, the variable name should start with lower-case_letter, and use underscores to seprate the words.Technically, this naming convention is called snake_case.
For eg:
```c
 char full_name;
int global_variable;
```
