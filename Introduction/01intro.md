## Introduction Of C

- C Programming is procedural oriented program, high level language.
- Used in the devlopment of computer software and applications, system programming, games, web devlopment ,and may more.
- Defined as the mother language, Structured programming  language, Mid-level programming language.

### History of C
- It was devloped by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories in 1972.
- It was devloped to write the UNIX operating system.

### Features of C
- Supports modular programming.
- faster than other programming language.
- widely used in system programming.
- Using DMA provides efficient memory management.

### Which Is The Best Code Editor For C Programming
- The best code editor is VS Code if you want to run the C program from a computer or laptop. You can download the dart extension from VS Code and start coding. You will learn more about installing C in the next topic. You can also use DartPad to run simple C programs in (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php) without installing anything.

### Basic Programming Terms
Important words that you often hear while learning programming languages.

- **Statements**: A statement is a command that tells a computer to do something. In C, you can end most statements with a semicolon `;`.
- **Expressions**: An Expression is a value or something that can be calculated as a value. The expression can be numbers, text, or some other type.
- **Keywords**: Keywords are reserved words that give special meaning to the Dart compiler. For example, `int`, `if`, `var`, `String`, `const`, etc.
- **Identifiers**: Identifiers are names created by the programmer to define variables, functions, classes, etc. Identifiers shouldn’t be keywords and must have a unique name. For example, `int age = 19;`, here age is an identifier. You will learn more about identifiers later in this course.
- **High-Level Programming Language**: High-Level Programming Language is easy to learn, user-friendly, and uses English-like sentences. For example, Dart, Java, etc.
- **Low-Level Programming Language**: Low-level programming language is hard to learn, non-user friendly, and deals with computer hardware components, e.g., machine and assembly language.
- **Syntax**: The Syntax is a programming language’s pattern or rules that give the concept to code.

 ## Key points
- C is a procedural programming language designed for developing system software like operating systems, compilers, and utilities.
- It's open-source and available on many platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- C provides a rich standard library includes functions for handling I/O operations, string manipulations.
- C remains relevant due to its simplicity, performance, and wide applicability in various domains.
