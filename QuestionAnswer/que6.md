###  What is the process to create increment and decrement statement in C?

There are two possible methods to perform this task.

- Use increment (++) and decrement (-) operator.
Example When x=4, x++ returns 5 and x- returns 3.

- Use conventional + or â€“ sign.
Example When x=4, use x+1 to get 5 and x-1 to get 3.
